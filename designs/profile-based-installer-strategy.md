# StackRox Installer Strategic Analysis: Developer Experience vs Enterprise Features

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive analysis of the StackRox ecosystem, meta templating framework, and configuration complexity, this document presents strategic options for the new Go-based installer. **Developer experience emerges as the highest-value target**, with enterprise features as a potential long-term evolution.

## Problem Statement

StackRox's current deployment system creates significant barriers to adoption through a complex multi-layer templating system that requires deep expertise and multiple tools. Analysis reveals that the current system covers less than 5% of available configuration options while imposing overwhelming complexity for basic use cases.

## Current State Analysis

### The Complexity Problem

StackRox's current deployment system creates significant barriers to adoption:

1. **3-Layer Templating System**: `.htpl` → `roxctl` → Helm → Kubernetes
2. **Image Flavor Complexity**: 3 flavors × different registries × version matrices  
3. **Tool Chain Dependencies**: roxctl + Helm + kubectl + registry auth
4. **120+ Enterprise Configuration Options**: Overwhelming for most use cases
5. **Meta Templating Preprocessing**: Cannot use standard Helm workflows

### Meta Templating Framework Analysis

The StackRox system employs a complex **3-layer templating system**:

```
1. Meta Templating (.htpl files) → Pre-processed by roxctl
2. Helm Templates (.tpl files) → Processed by Helm  
3. Kubernetes YAML → Final output
```

**Key Complexity Sources**:
- **Meta Values struct**: 60+ fields for meta templating
- **Image Flavor system**: 3 different flavors with different registries and image names
- **Feature flag injection**: Dynamic based on build-time configuration
- **Version management**: 15+ different component versions to coordinate
- **Registry authentication**: Multiple registries per flavor

### Developer Pain Points (Quantified)

- **Learning curve**: 2-4 hours to get first deployment working
- **Daily setup time**: 15-20 minutes for clean environment
- **Debugging complexity**: 30-60 minutes when things break
- **Tool dependencies**: 4+ tools to install and configure
- **Cognitive load**: 60+ concepts to understand (flavors, registries, meta templates, feature flags)

### Current Developer Workflow Reality

```bash
# What developers actually have to do:
1. Choose correct image flavor (development_build/rhacs/opensource)
2. Understand meta templating vs Helm templating
3. Use roxctl to pre-process .htpl files 
4. Generate appropriate values.yaml for the flavor
5. Deal with registry authentication for multiple registries
6. Handle version mismatches between components
7. Understand feature flag implications
8. Debug templating issues across 3 layers
```

**Critical Issue**: You can't just use Helm directly because:
- Raw .htpl files won't work with `helm install`
- Must use `roxctl helm output` to pre-process templates
- Image references are computed, not static
- Feature flags affect template rendering
- Chart metadata is templated

## Strategic Options Analysis

### Option 1: Enterprise Feature Parity
*"Build everything the CRDs support"*

**Scope**: Implement all 120+ configuration options found in Central/SecuredCluster CRDs

**Pros**:
- ✅ Complete feature parity with operator

```yaml
# Simple: Just works for most developers
profile: "development"

# Advanced: Production-ready enterprise config  
profile: "production"
resources:
  central: { cpu: "2", memory: "4Gi" }
exposure:
  type: "LoadBalancer"

# Expert: Full control when needed
profile: "custom"
# ... full configuration options
```

#### Profile Definitions

**Development Profile**:

}
```

### Flavor Integration Strategy

```go
type FlavorManager struct {
    flavors map[string]ImageFlavor
}

func (f *FlavorManager) AutoDetectFlavor() string {
    // Try RHACS access
    if canAccessRHACSImages() {
        return "rhacs"
    }
    
    // Try development registry
    if canAccessDevImages() {
        return "development_build"
    }
    
    // Fall back to opensource
    return "opensource"
}

func (f *FlavorManager) ResolveImages(config Config) Images {
    flavor := config.Images.Flavor
    if flavor == "" {
        flavor = f.AutoDetectFlavor()
    }
    
    baseImages := f.getFlavorImages(flavor)
    
    // Apply any user overrides
    return mergeImageOverrides(baseImages, config.Images)
}
```
